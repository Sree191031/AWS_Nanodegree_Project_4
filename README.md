# Price Setter and Follower Detection
**Problem Statement**<br/>
RedBus is an online platform where bus operators offer their services and sell seats.These bus operators vary from single service operators to ones which have scores of services.<br/>

Pricing is a complex decision for Bus Operators, who continuously adjust the prices seeing the demand and supply signals. But not all operators have the same level of visibility on these signals or the capability to price effectively. Operators who have better ability/confidence may price independently while some others may choose to follow the prices of such price setters.<br/>

**Objective**<br/>
Your challenge is to find out which services is/are pricing independently (the price leaders) and which services are the followers (and following whom?), given the history of prices set by the operators.<br/>
